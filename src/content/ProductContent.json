  "text": "The most interesting part about being a marketing professional is understanding people and their behavioral patterns. I have learnt from my experience in the events industry, everyone is not the same; one can be differentiated based on culture, industries, region etc. Marketing to me is about analysing what marketing channel (and/or medium) work for the target audience and how I can enhance the channel/s. When I am not enhancing my marketing knowledge , I love reading reality stories (written in fictional style), watching thriller, crime and family related TV series, learning Ai (Illustrator) and traveling the world. I look forward to connecting with you! "
